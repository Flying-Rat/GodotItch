# GodotItch

This repository was scaffolded with a minimal Godot project for quick testing and itch.io packaging.

Setup
1. Install Git LFS: https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Initialize LFS in this repo (already done if you run the included command):

	git lfs install

3. Open the project in Godot and run the `res://scenes/Main.tscn` scene.

Notes
- Binary assets (images, audio, etc.) are tracked via `.gitattributes` and should be stored using Git LFS.
